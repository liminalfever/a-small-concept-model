Working prototype for a Small Concept Model (SCM) based on Meta's Large Concept Model (LCM), with a custom embedding decoder for vec-to-text conversion.

> Most of the code used for the actual SCM architecture (PreNet and PostNet layers) is heavily inspired by [this implementation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZLd0uZvwbU).
